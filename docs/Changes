* It should be noted that this changelog is incomplete
* PipSqueek is mostly 'weekend code' until someone steps
* up to write some really good documentation for it.

[ 3.1 ]
- complete rewrite of 3.0b code
- kept same module style, but different API
- created several additional modules to make the job
  of module-writers easier
- patched PoCo::IRC for the optional part message to work
  (Needs a later version then 2.2, or just patch it yourself:
  Change the line:
  	'part' => \&commasep,
  To:
  	'part' => \&onlytwoargs,
- more flexible handlers, multiple events can be handled
  by a single module (see Handlers/IRC/Basic.pm)

<no active development for 1 day >

[ 3.0b ]
- complete rewrite of 2.0 code
- new modular handlers, using real perl modules
- new core code to accomidate the new handler format
- add Users.pm and Settings.pm to move some of the code
  out of the main program

< no active development for 4 months >

[ 2.0b ]
- cleaned up and released
- new handlers are 'modules' (which are really anonymous subs)
- removed !seen functionality (botserv does it anyway)

[ previous ]
- don't remember
- don't care
