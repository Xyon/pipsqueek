1.  NAME
	pipsqueek - more than just a friendly bot
	
2.  SYNOPSIS
	perl pipsqueek.pl [debug level]

	debug level can be one of the following:
	0	-	tell the code to stfu
	1	- 	emits general info about what's going on
	2	-	raw IRC log, plus general info
	
3.  DESCRIPTION
	pipsqueek is an automaton or 'bot' for IRC (Internet Relay Chat - RFC 1459).
	Most bots out there deal with channel protection and flood control. PipSqueek was not intended for that
	sort of work, and if you need those features, I suggest an eggdrop bot.  Instead, pipsqueek was created
	to be a sort of 'channel pet' for small IRC groups.

8.  BUGS
	I don't have time for / feel like fixing these:
	If there's only one user in the users.xml, several functions fail because of how XML::Simple works.
	This really shouldn't be a problem, since anyone on IRC with just themselves and this bot has issues.

	Most of the functions are case-sensitive, this probably just requires fixing the user_[s|g]et* functions
