Basic Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of PipSqueek from
	http://pipsqueek.l8nite.net/ PipSqueek is distributed as either a 
	tarball (.tar.gz extension) for Linux users, or a zip archive (.zip 
	extension) for Windows users.

	Check the 'PipSqueek Requirements' section to ensure that you have
	everything needed to run the bot.

	Unpack the archive into the directory you wish to install pipsqueek.
	The archive will automatically create a subdirectory called 'pipsqueek'

		(Linux):   tar -zxvf pipsqueek-version.tar.gz
		(Windows): right-click the archive and select 'unzip here'

	That's it, PipSqueek is now installed, now you have to configure it!
	See the section 'Basic Configuration'


Basic Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Most configuration items are stored in the file etc/pipsqueek.conf
	The few that you'll want to really tweak are in there.

	The important options to set are 'server_address', 'server_channel',
	'identity_nickname', and 'primary_admin'.  The rest are well
	documented and you should be able to figure them out.


Installing Perl Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	For the technically savvy, you can view comprehensive documentation
	using the 'perldoc' utility.  The page is 'perlmodinstall'.  The rest
	of this section is almost a verbatim copy of that perlpage.

	First, are you sure that the module isn't already on your system?
	You can find out using:

		perl -MFoo -e 1

	Replace "Foo" with the module name; ie, "perl -MCGI::Carp -e 1".

	If you don't see an error message, you have the module.  If you do see
	an error, it's still possible you have the module, but that it's not 
	in your path, which you can display with:

		perl -e 'print qq(@INC)'

	For the remainder of this document, we'll assume that you really are
	missing the module, but want to install it from CPAN.

	Also note that these instructions are tailored for installing the 
	modules into your system's repository of Perl modules, but you can 
	install them into any directory you wish using the PREFIX option.

	For example, wherever you see 'perl Makefile.PL', you can substitute
	'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/very/own/perl/directory'

	If you do install them into your own directory, you must ensure that
	any perl scripts you run know to look for modules there.  You can do
	this using the -I switch to perl.  See 'perldoc perlrun' for details.


Linux:

	You can use Andreas Koenig's CPAN module to automate the next steps
	( http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN ), ie:

		perl -MCPAN -e 'install Foo::Bar'

	First you have to find the module to install on CPAN, the 
	Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (http://search.cpan.org).

	So now you have a file ending in .tar.gz (or, less often, .zip).  You
	know there's a tasty module inside.  There are three steps involved.
	This is *not* a substitute for reading the README and INSTALL files
	that may have come with your module!

	UNPACK:
		If you have a tarball (.tar.gz extension) you can use GNU tar 
		to decompress and unpack the file:

			tar -zxvf file.tar.gz

		If you have a zip archive (.zip extension) you should use the
		'unzip' tool (ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/UnZip.html)

			unzip file.zip

	BUILD:
		Go into the newly created directory and run:

			perl Makefile.PL
			make
			make test

		Remember, if you want to install the perl module into a local
		directory, use 'perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/custom/directory'

	INSTALL:
		While still in the new directory, just run:

			make install

		Note that you will need root permissions for this step if 
		you are not installing it into a custom directory.

Windows:

	You can use ActiveState's PPM utility to see if it is available for
	installation from their repository of perl modules.  Just launch a
	shell (Start->Run - type in "cmd") and run:

		ppm

	You should see a prompt like 'ppm> '
	To search for a module, at the prompt type 'search Foo', ie:

		ppm> search Class::Accessor

	After which, you should see a list of results, the one you want to
	install is named 'Class-Accessor', to install it run:

		ppm> install Class-Accessor

	Repeat the procedure for whichever modules you need from the list at
	the top of this document.  So far, the only module which you will 
	have a problem finding is DBD::SQLite (for the !quote interface).
	To install it you must add a new repository to PPM, by running:

		ppm> repository add 
		http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/cgi-bin/ppmserver?urn:/PPMServer58
		(*note, this should be all on one line)

	After that repository is added, ppm should be able to find and install 
	the module without trouble :)

	If for some reason you are unable to install a module using ppm, 
	please email pipsqueek@l8nite.net and report it.  I have tested the 
	installation on Windows XP using ActiveState Perl 5.8.0, and I have 
	found all the modules required except DBD::SQLite (as noted above).
