* It should be noted that this changelog is incomplete
* PipSqueek is mostly 'weekend code' until someone steps
* up to write some really good documentation for it.

[ 3.2.3 ]
- added quotes database (uses DBD::SQLite)
- cleaned up warning messages
- added feature where if you run a public command in a privmsg
  the bot will message you back instead of displaying it in the
  channel (useful for when users like to check their score privately)
- re-added !math (had removed it pending an exploit fix)
- misc bugfixes, etc

[ 3.2.1 ]
- fixed error that occured when the bot was restarted but no
  users were added to the user's database
- updated handler loading, a single bot core can be installed now
  and then run from multiple locations (assuming that a data directory
  is valid in each place you run the bot from).
  Custom handlers will also be loaded from the cwd you run pipsqueek 
  in, and will override handlers already set by the core modules

[ 3.2 ]
- lots of bugfixes
- fixed an error in the !rank script that wouldn't report
  correct ranks
- added !math module
- added ability to rehash modules on the fly
- added online help features
- added !list to list the handlers available
- improved/added usage and description information
  for all public and admin commands

[ 3.1 ]
- complete rewrite of 3.0b code
- kept same module style, but different API
- created several additional modules to make the job
  of module-writers easier
- patched PoCo::IRC for the optional part message to work
  (Needs a later version then 2.2, or just patch it yourself:
  Change the line:
  	'part' => \&commasep,
  To:
  	'part' => \&onlytwoargs,
- more flexible handlers, multiple events can be handled
  by a single module (see Handlers/IRC/Basic.pm)

<no active development for 1 day >

[ 3.0b ]
- complete rewrite of 2.0 code
- new modular handlers, using real perl modules
- new core code to accomidate the new handler format
- add Users.pm and Settings.pm to move some of the code
  out of the main program

< no active development for 4 months >

[ 2.0b ]
- cleaned up and released
- new handlers are 'modules' (which are really anonymous subs)
- removed !seen functionality (botserv does it anyway)

[ previous ]
- don't remember
- don't care
