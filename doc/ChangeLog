* pipsqueek-4.0.1

	09 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net>
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Stats.pm, bin/pipsqueek.pl:
	Fixed a bug in the cloaking feature whereby a user couldn't use the
	!rank command to get their own stats.  Also, if a user requests the
	stats for themselves by typing their username out, the 'sorry!' message
	is displayed to them.  Also fixed an error whereby the VERSION number
	wasn't updated to 4.0.0 at release time :x

* pipsqueek-4.0.0

	07 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Stats.pm, misc files:
	Some minor touchups, a few typos caught, etc. Released.

	06 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/URLGrabber.pm, doc/INSTALL,
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugin.pm, *:
	Moved the URLGrabber to using URI::Find::Schemeless (much better than
	the crappy regex that was there before), updated INSTALL docs to note
	that it was required.  Also squashed a bug I thought had been fixed
	previously with the bot's nickname.  Prepped for release of 4.0.0

	01 Jun 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Some big style cleanups all over the place, added a logo to the README
	file, rewrote the delegation handler for commands, improved the help
	documentation, etc..  Time to get started on a tutorial for module
	writing :-)

	31 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> 
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Slap.pm, doc/INSTALL, lib/PipSqueek/Plugin.pm,
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Admin.pm, etc/pipsqueek.conf:
	Slapping someone now allows more than one word as the 'thing' to hit.
	Added more install information and configuration information, also
	documented the configuration file itself.  Cleaned up the way kicks
	were handled.  Fixed a small bug in the connection setup whereby if
	the bots nickname was set, it wouldn't tell the config module that it
	was using the default 'PipSqueek'.  So any further attempts to match
	the bot's nickname would fail (nickname is nothing).

	30 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Another large cleanup of the code, overhauled the semantics of the way
	pipsqueek tracks nicknames and maps them to their stats.  Squashed a
	lot of bugs related to various plugin modules, fixed up an error in
	the stats tracking that arose from the new nickname tracking code.
	Rewrote the stats module to take advantage of the new tracking, etc.

	27 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/plugins/*, 
	lib/PipSqueek/Plugins/Help.pm, doc/README, doc/logo.txt:
	Wrote initial help for each event handler and finished Help interface.
	Added updated README file with better formatting, new credits to Cyon.
	Added doc/logo.txt with the original PipSqueek ascii art logo!

	26 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/INSTALL:
	Added initial requirements, installation, configuration sections.
	Also added a section on installing perl modules

	25 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> doc/Changelog:
	Created Changelog (slightly modeled after gentoo's changelog format)

	11 May 2003; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	A complete, 90% from scratch, rewrite of the code.  Improved module
	semantics, improved API, improved core, updated configuration, newer
	features, and much, much, more!


# It should be noted that the changelog prior to this is incomplete and most
# likely innaccurate too.  It is pieced together from development notes and
# snapshots of pipsqueek's homepage from the wayback machine ;)
# PipSqueek up to this point was mostly learning code, not release code.

* pipsqueek-3.2.2

	07 Oct 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Added quotes database using DBD::SQLite, cleaned up various warning
	messages, hacked in a feature to have the bot respond to handlers in a
	private message (useful for users that like to check their score or
	stats in private), added the math handler again after some cleanup of
	the exploitable code (still uses eval), misc bugfixes, etc...

* pipsqueek-3.2.1

	20 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Fixed an error that occured when the bot was restarted but no users
	had been added to the database yet.  Updated the handler loading so
	that the primary code can be in a single directory, and still be run
	for multiple channels.  Custom handlers will also be loaded from the 
	cwd you run pipsqueek in, and will override handlers already set

* pipsqueek-3.2.0

	17 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Lots of bugfixes, fixed an error in the ranking output that caused 
	incorrect ranks to be calculated, added a math evaluation module, added
	the ability to reload plugin modules on the fly, added online help, 
	added a command to list the commands available, and also updated and
	improved the usage/description info for all public and admin commands

* pipsqueek-3.1.0

	15 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Complete rewrite of 3.0b code, kept same module style but implemented a
	different API.  Created several additional modules for making the jobs
	of module-writers easier.  Patched POE::Component::IRC to make part
	messages work properly (or just use version 2.2 or later).  Made the
	handler modules more flexible (one module can handle several events).

* pipsqueek-3.0.0b

	03 Jul 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Complete rewrite of the 2.0 code.  PipSqueek now uses full-fledged perl
	objects as handlers.  Added new core code to accomodate the new handler
	formats, added a Users.pm and Settings.pm to move some of the code out
	of the primary pipsqueek.pl script.

* pipsqueek-2.0.0b

	13 Mar 2002; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Cleaned up and released as an actual package.  Moved handlers to files
	defined outside of the main code (they just contain anonymous subs).
	Removed the !seen functionality since Epona botserv was providing it
	anyway.
	
* pipsqueek-1.4.0

	15 Sep 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Another complete rewrite removing a ton of excess code, and reducing 
	memory/processor usage. This version of pipsqueek also did away with
	the Net::IRC module in favor of POE::Component::IRC, a much more
	frequently  updated and stable module (thanks to a tip from #perl)

* pipsqueek-1.2.2

	26 Jul 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	This was just a maintenance update that fixed a regex problem with the
	public command prefix when it was set to '.'.  The pipsqueek installer
	script was also enhanced slightly.

* pipsqueek-1.2.1

	25 Jul 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	This version fixes a few minor formatting issues and integrates the 
	Chatbot::Eliza perl module to give the bot a truly unique personality!
	Also included with this release is an updated install script. 
	* This was the first public release of pipsqueek's code

* pipsqueek-1.1.0
	
	?? ??? 2001; Shaun Guth <l8nite@l8nite.net> *:
	Added language translations (canadian, eh?) and some prelim support for
	new commands... ???

* pipsqueek-1.0.0
* pipsqueek-0.3.0
