{"name":"Pipsqueek","tagline":"A friendly IRC bot","body":"# PipSqueek - More than just a friendly bot! #\r\nPipsqueek is a fork of the [Pipsqueek Project](http://code.google.com/p/pipsqueek/).\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\nPipSqueek is an automaton or 'bot' for IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Most IRC bots you will find are designed for protecting a channel from hostile takeovers or flooding.  This is not the sort of work PipSqueek is meant to be doing (although it is flexible enough to support it).\r\n\r\nPipSqueek was created to be a sort of 'channel pet' for IRC channels. This means it will keep notes of the users, store stats and quotes, and try to be as helpful as possible without being in the way. Many IRC users live and swear by the \"PipSqueek way of life\" :-)\r\n\r\n## Installation and Configuration ##\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/mozor/pipsqueek/wiki) or file [INSTALL](https://github.com/mozor/pipsqueek/blob/master/doc/INSTALL) for help on installation and configuration.\r\n\r\n## Author ##\r\nThe original PipSqueek is written by [Shaun Guth](https://github.com/l8nite).
